    "These numbers all seem pretty reasonable, but not much analysis can be done in the absence of touchdown and long return data. Note that these numbers seem to say that there is about one loss of possession due to kickoff return in the league every week. Thus, we would say that a team has about a 3.4% chance of losing a possession due to returned kicks per week. Those are about \n",

    "\n",
    "What we can say from this section is that it's absolutely essential to consider the context in regards to time, team, and player when looking at returns. The goal of this notebook is not to definitively say whether big plays on kickoffs are a net positive or negative, but rather to get an idea of the ballpark that turnovers and touchdowns occur at.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we found a rather large issue when actually looking at the turnover columns themselves: a number of plays that were ruled a fumble and reversed are in this dataset. We'll exclude these and check the rest of the dataset for similar errors. It's particularly worth noting that we may be missing plays that were ruled not a fumble and then were successfully challenged for a fumble."
